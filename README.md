# Bdecisive - Booking.com Taipei Hack 

Do you have the experience that you and your friends go traveling and you are the one planning the tour, after you plan it and arrive the spot/hotel, just a few people mourning about your decision?

So we are making a service to make planning decision more easy. 

We are going to build a hotel version of doodle. Allowing your friends who are travelling with you to vote on the hotel they like.
